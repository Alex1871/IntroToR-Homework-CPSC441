# Question 2a: solve the equations x + 3y = 19 and 2x + 5y = 33 

# make matrix of Xs and Ys
firstpart <- matrix(c(2, 1, 5, 3),nrow=2,ncol=2)

# make matrix of answers
secondpart <- matrix(c(33,19),nrow=2,ncol=1)

answer <- solve(firstpart,secondpart)

# Question 2b: make a vector of 1 to 100 and caluclate average without using 'mean'

# create vector
vector <- (1:100)

# divide sum by number of elements
av <- (sum(vector))/100
av

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
